[R](http://www.r-project.org/) Is a free and open source statistical program and language. It is quickly becoming the [*de facto* standard](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/) for data analysis.

#### Downloading and Install R

I have provided access to running R in a Google Chrome browser at [rstudio.bryer.org](http://rstudio.bryer.org) so that you do not need to install any software. [Contact me](mailto:jason@bryer.org) if you have any trouble logging in. However, if you wish to install R and [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) on your own computer, you can following the [instructions here](Installation/Install.md).


#### Resources

* [Quick-R](http://statmethods.net/) - by Robert I. Kabacoff. This is, IMHO, perhaps the single most useful resource for working with R. His book, *R in Action* is also highly recommended. A link to purchase his book with a discount is available on the [statmethods.net](http://statmethods.net) website.

* [simpleR - Using R for Introductory Statistics](http://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/Statistics/R/simpleR/printable/simpleR.pdf) by John Verzani
