## Histograms

*** left

* First introduced by Karl Pearson, a histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data.
* The interval of data are divided into bins (on the x-axis) and the y-axis is simply a count of data points within that bin.

*** right

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
hist(movies$Running.Time)
```

---

## Histograms (with ggplot2)

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Running.Time)) + geom_histogram()
```

--- &twocol

## Histograms (with ggplot2): Binwidths

*** left

* Different bin widths tell different stories.
* Choose the width that best shows the important features.
* Presentations can feature two histograms that present the same data in different ways.
* A gap in the histogram means that there were no occurrences in that range.


*** right

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=6, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Running.Time)) + 
	geom_histogram(binwidth=15)
```

---

## Outliers

```{r}
movies[movies$Running.Time < 50, ]
```

--- 

## Stem and Leaf Plot

```{r}
stem(movies$Running.Time)
```

## Modes

A Mode of a histogram is a hump or high-frequency bin.
* One mode → Unimodal
* Two modes → Bimodal
* 3 or more → Multimodal

<table border=0 width='100%'><tr><td>
<img src='Figures/Class04-unimodal.png' width='300'>
</td><td>
<img src='Figures/Class04-bimodal.png' width='300'>
</td><td>
<img src='Figures/Class04-multimodal.png' width='300'>
</td></tr></table>

---

## Uniform Distributions

* Uniform Distribution: All the bins have the same frequency, or at least close to the same frequency.
* The histogram for a uniform distribution will be flat.

## Symmetry

The histogram for a symmetric distribution will look the same on the left and the right of its center.

<table border=0 width='100%'><tr><td>
<img src='Figures/Class04-Symmetric.png' width='300'>
</td><td>
<img src='Figures/Class04-NotSymmetric.png' width='300'>
</td><td>
<img src='Figures/Class04-Symmetric2.png' width='300'>
</td></tr></table>

## Skewness

*** left

A histogram is skewed left if the longer tail is on the left side of the mode.

Negatively Skewed

<img src='Figures/Class04-SkewLeft.png' width=400>

*** right

A histogram is skewed right if the longer tail is on the right side of the mode.

Positively Skewed

## Center: Median

* Median: The center of the data values 
* Half of the data values are to the left of the median and half are to the right of the median.

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=12, tidy=FALSE}
(mediantime <- median(movies$Running.Time))
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Running.Time, y='Length')) + geom_point() + 
	geom_vline(xintercept=mediantime, color='blue')
```

---

## Center: Mean

* The Mean is what most people think of as the average.

$$ \overline { y } =\frac { \sum { y }  }{ n } $$

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=12, tidy=FALSE}
(meantime <- mean(movies$Running.Time))
ggplot(movies, aes(x=Running.Time, y='Length')) + geom_point() + 
	geom_vline(xintercept=mediantime, color='blue') + geom_vline(xintercept=meantime, color='red')
```

---

## Median vs. Mean

* For symmetric distributions, the mean and the median are equal.
* The balancing point is at the center.
* The tail "pulls" the mean towards it more than it does to the median.
* The mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median.
* The mean is larger than the median since it is "pulled" to the right by the outlier
* The median is a better measure of the center for data that is skewed.

Why Use the Mean?

* Although the median is a better measure of the center, the mean weighs in large and small values better.
* The mean is easier to work with.
* For symmetric data, statisticians would rather use the mean.
* It is always ok to report both the mean and the median.

---

## Spread

* Locating the center is only part of the story
* Are the data all near the center or are they spread out?
* Is the highest value much higher than the lowest value?
* To describe data, we must discuss both the <i>center</i> and the <i>spread</i>.

## Range

* The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Range = Maximum – Minimum
* The range is sensitive to outliers.  A single high or low value will affect the range significantly.

---

## Percentiles and Quartiles

* Percentiles divide the data in one hundred groups.
* The <b>nth percentile</b> is the data value such that n percent of the data lies below that value.
* For large data sets, the median is the 50th percentile.
* The median of the lower half of the data is the <b>25th percentile</b> and is called the <b>first quartile</b> (Q1).
* The median of the upper half of the data is the <b>75th percentile</b> and is called the <b>third quartile</b> (Q3).
* The <b>Interquartile Range</b> (IQR) is the difference between    the upper quartile and the lower quartile: IQR = Q3 – Q1

```{r}
summary(movies$Running.Time)
```

## Boxplots

*** left

* A Boxplot is a chart that displays the 5-Point Summary and the outliers.
* The Box shows the Interquartile Range.
* The dashed lines are called fences, outside the fences lie the outliers.
* Above and below the box are the whiskers that display the most extreme data values within the fences.
* The line inside the box shows the median.


*** right

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=6}
boxplot(movies$Running.Time)
```

## Boxplots

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=6}
ggplot(movies, aes(x='Movie', y=Running.Time)) + geom_boxplot()
```

---

## Boxplots

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(titanic, aes(x=survived, y=age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

---

## Variance

$$ { S }^{ 2 }=\frac { \sum { \left( y-\overline { y }  \right)  }  }{ n-1 } $$

* The variance is a measure of how far the data is spread out from the mean.
* The difference from the mean is: $y - \overline{y}$
* To make it positive, square it.
* Then find the average of all of these distances, except instead of dividing by n, divide by n – 1.
* Use ${S}^{2}$ to represent the variance.
* The variance will mostly be used to find the standard deviation s which is the square root of the variance.

--- 

## Standard Deviation

$$ S=\sqrt { \frac { \sum { \left( y-\overline { y }  \right)  }  }{ n-1 }  } $$

* The variance’s units are the square of the original units.
* Taking the square root of the variance gives the standard deviation, which will have the same units as y.
* The standard deviation is a number that is close to the average distances that the y values are from the mean.
* If data values are close to the mean (less spread out), then the standard deviation will be small.
* If data values are far from the mean (more spread out), then the standard deviation will be large.
